abstract: "This retrospective multisite cohort study examines the limitations of developing a single generalisable AI model for sepsis prediction. We demonstrate significant performance variations across different hospital sites and patient populations, highlighting the presence of dataset shift and model bias. The study proposes practical mitigation strategies including site-specific calibration, ensemble methods, and continuous model monitoring to improve real-world deployment of AI sepsis prediction systems."
