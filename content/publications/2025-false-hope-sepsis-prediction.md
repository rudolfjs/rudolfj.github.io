abstract: "<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To identify bias in using a single machine
learning (ML) sepsis prediction model across multiple
hospitals and care locations; evaluate the impact of six
different bias mitigation strategies and propose a generic
modelling approach for developing best-performing
models.</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> We developed a baseline ML model to predict
sepsis using retrospective data on patients in emergency
departments (EDs) and wards across nine hospitals.
We set model sensitivity at 70% and determined the
number of alerts required to be evaluated (number
needed to evaluate (NNE), 95% CI) for each case of true
sepsis and the number of hours between the first alert
and timestamped outcomes meeting sepsis-3 reference
criteria (HTS3). Six bias mitigation models were compared
with the baseline model for impact on NNE and HTS3.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Across 969 292 admissions, mean NNE for
the baseline model was significantly lower for EDs (6.1
patients, 95% CI 6 to 6.2) than for wards (7.5 patients,
95% CI 7.4 to 7.5). Across all sites, median HTS3 was
20 hours (20–21) for wards vs 5 (5–5) for EDs. Bias
mitigation models significantly impacted NNE but not
HTS3. Compared with the baseline model, the best-
performing models for NNE with reduced interhospital
variance were those trained separately on data from
ED patients or from ward patients across all sites. These
models generated the lowest NNE results for all care
locations in seven of nine hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Implementing a single sepsis prediction
model across all sites and care locations within
multihospital systems may be unacceptable given large
variances in NNE across multiple sites. Bias mitigation
methods can identify models demonstrating improved
performance across most sites in reducing alert burden
but with no impact on the length of the prediction
window.</p>"
