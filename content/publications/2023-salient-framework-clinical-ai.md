abstract: "<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To derive a comprehensive implementation framework for clinical AI models within hospitals informed by existing AI frameworks and
integrated with reporting standards for clinical AI research.</p>
<p><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong> (1) Derive a provisional implementation framework based on the taxonomy of Stead et al and integrated with current
reporting standards for AI research: TRIPOD, DECIDE-AI, CONSORT-AI. (2) Undertake a scoping review of published clinical AI implementation
frameworks and identify key themes and stages. (3) Perform a gap analysis and reﬁne the framework by incorporating missing items.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The provisional AI implementation framework, called SALIENT, was mapped to 5 stages common to both the taxonomy and the report-
ing standards. A scoping review retrieved 20 studies and 247 themes, stages, and subelements were identiﬁed. A gap analysis identiﬁed 5 new
cross-stage themes and 16 new tasks. The ﬁnal framework comprised 5 stages, 7 elements, and 4 components, including the AI system, data
pipeline, human-computer interface, and clinical workﬂow.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> This pragmatic framework resolves gaps in existing stage- and theme-based clinical AI implementation guidance by comprehen-
sively addressing the what (components), when (stages), and how (tasks) of AI implementation, as well as the who (organization) and why (policy
domains). By integrating research reporting standards into SALIENT, the framework is grounded in rigorous evaluation methodologies. The
framework requires validation as being applicable to real-world studies of deployed AI models.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> A novel end-to-end framework has been developed for implementing AI within hospital clinical practice that builds on previous AI
implementation frameworks and research reporting standards.</p>"
