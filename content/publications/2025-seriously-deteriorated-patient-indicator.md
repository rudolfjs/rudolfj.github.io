abstract: "<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Current deteriorated patient outcome measures, death and unplanned ICU admission
(UPICU), don’t consider patients who deteriorate and recover on the ward, nor correctly identify the
time that significant deterioration occurs. This limits fair comparative evaluation of Early Warning Tool
(EWT) performance and may degrade AI deterioration prediction algorithm accuracy. A Seriously
Deteriorated Patient Indicator (SDPI) is required to overcome these limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> Using a multi-hospital, retrospective dataset and supported by a clinician
committee, we developed the SDPI by (i) identifying a well-embedded baseline EWT with superior
identification of patients who would transfer to the ICU in the setting of severe illness, (ii) testing
additions/variations in scoring elements to improve that tools accuracy, and (iii) selecting an SDPI
threshold above which patients are labelled as seriously deteriorated.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> 957,445 ward episodes were included (UPICU prevalence 0.4%). The superior baseline tool
(AUPRC 0.0752), was successfully augmented by 13.1% (AUPRC 0.085) through 11 adjustments. The
final SDPI identified 12,323 seriously deteriorated patients (1.3% of the cohort), of which 8,701
(0.9% of cohort) recovered on the ward, identifying deteriorating patients 7.2 and 71 hours earlier
than UPICU or death outcomes respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> This physiologically derived, reproducible SDPI identifies deteriorated patients
significantly earlier than UPICU or death and includes a significant cohort of seriously deteriorated
patients who would have previously been mislabelled as ‘not deteriorated’.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> We propose this novel SDPI as part of a composite outcome measure for fairer
evaluation of EWT performance and better training of AI prediction models.</p>"

This preprint introduces a novel indicator system for identifying seriously deteriorated patients in hospital ward settings, aiming to improve early detection and intervention strategies.
