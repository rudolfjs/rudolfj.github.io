abstract: "<p><strong>Background:</strong> The role of clinician-researchers in regional healthcare is
challenging. Balancing patient care, academic research, and mentoring junior
staff signiﬁcantly burdens these dedicated professionals. Therefore, the
Australian healthcare system must provide institutional support for improving
clinicians’ academic performance.</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> This paper describes two digital solutions implemented in a regional
Australian Hospital and Health Service. The Audit, Quality, and Innovation
Review panel simpliﬁes the approval process using digital workﬂows for quality
assurance and audit projects, and the Research Data Laboratory provides
secure access to de-identiﬁed patient data and supports data analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> Unlike some countries, such as the US and UK, where ﬁnancial
incentives or established networks drive research integration, the Townsville
Hospital and Health Service focuses on empowering clinicians to address local
healthcare issues through research directly. This makes the Townsville Hospital
and Health Service a standout example in Australian healthcare, highlighting
the signiﬁcance of specialised research infrastructure and data services for
clinician-led audit projects and research. This digital health solutions approach
is essential for closing the gap between research and practical application,
ultimately leading to improved patient care. Importantly, as a service-
embedded structure, this model may be more sustainable and effective than
traditional models reliant on external funding or networks in regional settings</p>"
