abstract: "<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To retrieve and appraise studies of deployed artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)-based sepsis prediction
algorithms using systematic methods, identify implementation barriers, enablers, and key decisions and then
map these to a novel end-to-end clinical AI implementation framework.</p>
<p><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong> Systematically review studies of clinically applied AI-based sepsis prediction algorithms
in regard to methodological quality, deployment and evaluation methods, and outcomes. Identify contextual fac-
tors that inﬂuence implementation and map these factors to the SALIENT implementation framework.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The review identiﬁed 30 articles of algorithms applied in adult hospital settings, with 5 studies
reporting signiﬁcantly decreased mortality post-implementation. Eight groups of algorithms were identiﬁed,
each sharing a common algorithm. We identiﬁed 14 barriers, 26 enablers, and 22 decision points which were
able to be mapped to the 5 stages of the SALIENT implementation framework.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong> Empirical studies of deployed sepsis prediction algorithms demonstrate their potential for improv-
ing care and reducing mortality but reveal persisting gaps in existing implementation guidance. In the exam-
ined publications, key decision points reﬂecting real-word implementation experience could be mapped to the
SALIENT framework and, as these decision points appear to be AI-task agnostic, this framework may also be
applicable to non-sepsis algorithms. The mapping clariﬁed where and when barriers, enablers, and key deci-
sions arise within the end-to-end AI implementation process.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> A systematic review of real-world implementation studies of sepsis prediction algorithms was
used to validate an end-to-end staged implementation framework that has the ability to account for key factors
that warrant attention in ensuring successful deployment, and which extends on previous AI implementation
frameworks.</p>"
