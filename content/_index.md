I'm a researcher specialising in the evaluation and validation of AI and machine learning systems in healthcare. My work focuses on testing and evaluating clinical AI models before implementation, characterising their performance, detecting biases, and ensuring they're robust and ready for clinical practice.

Currently, I'm investigating bias mitigation strategies in clinical AI models, developing early warning systems for patient deterioration, and exploring the challenges of deploying ML solutions across diverse healthcare environments.

## Research Interests

- **AI Model Evaluation & Validation** - Rigorous testing methodologies for clinical AI systems
- **Bias Detection in Healthcare AI** - Characterising and understanding algorithmic bias in clinical prediction models
- **High-Performance Computing for Digital Health** - Scalable computational platforms for healthcare data and AI workloads
- **Clinical Data Engineering** - Building robust data pipelines and infrastructure for healthcare research
