## Welcome to My Technical Blog

This is where I'll be sharing insights about machine learning in healthcare, digital health solutions, and technical implementations. Expect detailed technical content, code examples, and research discussions.

### What to Expect

Posts will include:

1. Technical tutorials with code examples
2. Research insights and findings
3. Implementation strategies
4. Healthcare ML case studies

### Example Code Snippet

Here's a simple example of how code will be presented in the blog:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def prepare_healthcare_data(data, target_col, test_size=0.2):
    """
    Prepare healthcare dataset for ML training
    
    Args:
        data (pd.DataFrame): Input healthcare data
        target_col (str): Name of the target column
        test_size (float): Proportion of test set
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of train and test sets
    """
    X = data.drop(target_col, axis=1)
    y = data[target_col]
    
    return train_test_split(X, y, test_size=test_size, random_state=42)
```

### Mathematics and Formulas

We can also include mathematical formulas when needed:

$$
\text{accuracy} = \frac{\text{true positives} + \text{true negatives}}{\text{total samples}}
$$

### Future Topics

Some topics I plan to cover:

- Implementing ML models for healthcare prediction
- Working with FHIR and HL7 data
- Best practices for healthcare data preprocessing
- Performance optimization in ML models
- Real-world case studies

Stay tuned for more technical content!
